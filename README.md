# Loops and Functions :

# Introduction

Loops and functions are fundamental concepts in programming that help in performing repetitive tasks efficiently and organizing code into reusable blocks. Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, while functions enable you to encapsulate code into callable units.

# Loops: 

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are essential for tasks that require iteration, such as traversing arrays or collections, and executing code until a certain condition is met.

# Functions :

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, making it more readable, and reducing redundancy.

# Conclusion :

Understanding loops and functions is crucial for any programmer. Loops allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently, while functions help in organizing and reusing code. By mastering these concepts, you can write cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code.
